Transforming equation into cano-nical form
 
The equation will be given in the following form:
P1 + P2 + ... = ... + PN
where P1..PN - summands , which look like:
ax^k

For example:
1) "x^2 + 3.5xy + y = y^2 - xy + y" should be transformed into: "x^2 - y^2 + 4.5xy = 0"
2) "x = 1" => "x - 1 = 0"
3) "x - (y^2 - x) = 0" => "2x - y^2 = 0"
4) "x - (0 - (0 - x)) = 0" => "0 = 0"
